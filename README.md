> Display Cryptopia's current coins, and sort by basemarket

Wunderlist 8/13/2018:
- Integrate https://quasar-framework.org/ (thx [@ampakinetic](https://github.com/ampakinetic))
- Store current price in localStorage & create an additional/replacement % change "since you last
checked"
- Allow one-time private API key import, snapshotting holdings then deleting key (store
localStorage or otherwise)
- Add portfolio visualization features
